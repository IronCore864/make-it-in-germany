## Requirements

The following reply is official, from hotline-germany@bamf.bund.de, in early 2018.

Pay attention to the minimum salary requirement, which changes from year to year.

> The Blue Card EU is a specific visa for highly-qualified persons. The visa entitles to work and offers several advantages. The [Blue Card EU flyer](http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/EN/Publikationen/Flyer/flyer-blaue-karte.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) provides further information. These are the most important requirements:
>
> 1. Proof of a German academic degree or a recognized foreign academic degree or a comparable foreign academic degree to a German degree 
>
> The database "[anabin](http://anabin.kmk.org/)" documents information on foreign universities and degrees.  An academic degree is equivalent to a German degree, if the precise university degree is listed as “gleichwertig” or “entspricht” \(German for “equivalent”\) in this database. Additionally, the university has to be recognized and rated with an H+. The university can be searched for [HERE](http://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/institutionen.html) and the academic degree [HERE.](http://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/hochschulabschluesse.html)
>
> In case there is no information on the degree in the database, it is necessary to apply for an evaluation by the Central Office for Foreign Education. Detailed information concerning the evaluation can be found [HERE](https://www.kmk.org/zab/central-office-for-foreign-education/statement-of-comparability-for-foreign-higher-education-qualifications.html).
>
> Please note that there are so-called regulated professions in Germany, especially in the fields of health and education \(e.g. physicians, pharmacists, teachers at state schools\). Persons working within these professions need a state license, so they need recognition of their foreign qualification before permission to work will be granted. In these cases, print-outs from anabin or a Statement of Comparability are _\*\*not sufficient\*\*_.
>
> The information portal "[Anerkennung in Deutschland](http://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/html/en/index.php)" helps to find out whether the profession is regulated or not.
>
> 1. Submission of an employment contract or a binding job offer that is suitable to the qualification
>
> 2. Proof of a minimum annual gross salary of 52,000 €. Exception: A lower salary threshold of 40,560 € is applied for EU Blue Cards issued to scientists, mathematicians and engineers, as well as to doctors and IT specialists

In my case, every document is good, I submitted on Thursday morning, went back again in the afternoon to sign one of the documents that I forgot, then I got the notification next Tuesday afternoon. In all it's only 3 working days, super fast.
