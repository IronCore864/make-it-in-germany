<p>In general there are three types of work visa:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visa for EU Blue Card</li>
<li>Visa for the Purpose of Gaining Employment</li>
<li>Other types (residence permit)</li>
</ul>
<p>Only &quot;Visa for the Purpose of Gaining Employment&quot; does not require a working contract. All the other types of work visa require a working contract.</p>
<h2 id="for-chinese">For Chinese</h2>
<p>If applying in China, see <a href="https://china.diplo.de/cn-zh/service/visa-einreise" title="china.diplo.de" target="_blank">HERE</a>. German embassy in China has Chinese and English versions and they list all useful information and required documents to make it much easier.</p>
<h1 id="visa-for-eu-blue-card">Visa for EU Blue Card</h1>
<h2 id="do-i-need-a-visa">Do I need a Visa</h2>
<p>From &quot;Who can Apply for EU Blue Card in Germany&quot; section in eu-bluecard.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EU citizens do not need a visa or a residency permit to neither enter nor start working within Germany. The same applies for the citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. A valid passport or identity card is sufficient.<br>Citizens of the following states can enter Germany without a visa but cannot take up employment before applying for the EU Blue Card:</p>
<ol>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Israel</li>
<li>Japan</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>South Korea</li>
<li>New Zealand</li>
<li>the United States of America</li>
</ol>
<p>The time allowed to stay in Germany for the citizens of the aforementioned countries is approximately 3 months which is usually not sufficient to find employment therefore the request for an EU Blue Card is obligatory. You may apply during your stay in Germany.</p>
<p>Citizens of the following states may apply for a work and residence permit after entering Germany without a visa:</p>
<ol>
<li>Andorra</li>
<li>Antigua and Barbuda</li>
<li>Argentina</li>
<li>Bahamas</li>
<li>Barbados</li>
<li>Brazil</li>
<li>Brunei</li>
<li>Darussalam</li>
<li>Chile</li>
<li>Costa Rica</li>
<li>El Salvador</li>
<li>Guatemala</li>
<li>Honduras</li>
<li>Macau</li>
<li>Malaysia</li>
<li>Mauritius</li>
<li>Mexico</li>
<li>Monaco</li>
<li>Nicaragua</li>
<li>Panama</li>
<li>Paraguay</li>
<li>San Marino</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>Saint Kitts and Nevis</li>
<li>Taiwan</li>
<li>Uruguay</li>
<li>the Vatican</li>
<li>Venezuela</li>
</ol>
<p>Non-EU citizens, on the other hand, must apply for a visa &#x2013; employment visa, visit, student, or other type of visa coherent with necessity &#x2013; while still in their home countries. The required documentation for application should be completed in conformity with the rules of the German Embassy in your home country. Once the visa is obtained, it is obligatory to respect the period allowed to stay.<br>In case you found a job before entering Germany, then you can immediately apply for the EU Blue Card while in your home country by the help of your employer.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>The following reply is official, from hotline-germany@bamf.bund.de, in early 2018.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the minimum salary requirement, which changes from year to year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Blue Card EU is a specific visa for highly-qualified persons. The visa entitles to work and offers several advantages. The <a href="http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/EN/Publikationen/Flyer/flyer-blaue-karte.pdf?__blob=publicationFile" target="_blank">Blue Card EU flyer</a> provides further information. These are the most important requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proof of a German academic degree or a recognized foreign academic degree or a comparable foreign academic degree to a German degree </li>
</ol>
<p>The database &quot;<a href="http://anabin.kmk.org/" target="_blank">anabin</a>&quot; documents information on foreign universities and degrees.  An academic degree is equivalent to a German degree, if the precise university degree is listed as &#x201C;gleichwertig&#x201D; or &#x201C;entspricht&#x201D; (German for &#x201C;equivalent&#x201D;) in this database. Additionally, the university has to be recognized and rated with an H+. The university can be searched for <a href="http://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/institutionen.html" target="_blank">HERE</a> and the academic degree <a href="http://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/hochschulabschluesse.html" target="_blank">HERE.</a></p>
<p>In case there is no information on the degree in the database, it is necessary to apply for an evaluation by the Central Office for Foreign Education. Detailed information concerning the evaluation can be found <a href="https://www.kmk.org/zab/central-office-for-foreign-education/statement-of-comparability-for-foreign-higher-education-qualifications.html" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that there are so-called regulated professions in Germany, especially in the fields of health and education (e.g. physicians, pharmacists, teachers at state schools). Persons working within these professions need a state license, so they need recognition of their foreign qualification before permission to work will be granted. In these cases, print-outs from anabin or a Statement of Comparability are <em>**not sufficient**</em>.</p>
<p>The information portal &quot;<a href="http://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/html/en/index.php" target="_blank">Anerkennung in Deutschland</a>&quot; helps to find out whether the profession is regulated or not.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Submission of an employment contract or a binding job offer that is suitable to the qualification</p>
</li>
<li><p>Proof of a minimum annual gross salary of 52,000 &#x20AC;. Exception: A lower salary threshold of 40,560 &#x20AC; is applied for EU Blue Cards issued to scientists, mathematicians and engineers, as well as to doctors and IT specialists</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="required-documents">Required Documents</h2>
<p><a href="https://china.diplo.de/blob/1341634/b46731f8bcc85e320fb7c99f687dc0ee/pdf-merkblatt-natvisum-blauekarteeu-data.pdf" title="china.diplo.de" target="_blank">Required documents for blue card application</a> in Chinese.</p>
<p><em>The documents might differ, if you apply in other countries. Welcome to add more info on this section.</em></p>
<p>Required documents listed by German embassy in European country (Estonia, to be specific):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Passport</p>
</li>
<li><p>Application (and Declaration in accordance with Section 55 (2) of the Residence</p>
</li>
<li><p>Curriculum vitae of professional career, including certificates, diplomas, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>German university degree or recognised foreign degree comparable to a German degree</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contract/binding job offer with details of gross annual salary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take">How Long Does it Take</h2>
<p>According to official reply from German embassy in Estonia, it takes 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>You don&apos;t leave your passport at the embassy. They will let you know by email when it&apos;s ready and you go again with your passport to collect the visa.</p>
<p>In my case, every document is good, I submitted on Thursday morning, went back again in the afternoon to sign one of the documents that I forgot, then I got the notification next Tuesday afternoon. In all it&apos;s only 3 working days, super fast.</p>
<h1 id="visa-for-the-purpose-of-gaining-employment">Visa for the Purpose of Gaining Employment</h1>
<p>The following is the official reply, from L. Schilling, on behalf of hotline-germany bamf.bund.de:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do not fullfill the above mentioned requirements there might be the following options for you:</p>
<p>With a university degree it is possible to apply for the following visa types:</p>
<p>To find a job, a visa for the purpose of job-seeking (according to sec. 18c Residence Act) can be applied for. This visa entitles to search for a job in Germany within six months. These are the most important requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of a German academic degree or a recognized foreign academic degree or a comparable foreign academic degree to a German degree.</li>
</ul>
<p>(see above)</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof that the applicant&#x2019;s livelihood is secured for the whole period of stay in Germany</li>
</ul>
<p>Important note:</p>
<p>Please note that it is illegal to work with this type of visa until a job is found which matches the university degree. Before starting to work, it is necessary to change the visa for the purpose of job-seeking into a residence permit for the purpose of gaining employment. This residence permit can be applied for at the local immigration office (Ausl&#xE4;nderbeh&#xF6;rde). The corresponding immigration office can be found <a href="http://www.bamf.de/SiteGlobals/Functions/WebGIS/EN/WebGIS_Auslaenderbehoerde.html" title="www.bamf.de" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="other-types-of-working-visa">Other Types of Working Visa</h1>
<p>The following is the official reply, from L. Schilling, on behalf of hotline-germany bamf.bund.de:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all other visa types an employment contract or a binding job offer is required.</p>
<p>Author note: if you have a contract but salary is lower than blue card requirement, this type applies. You may apply for a residence permit.</p>
