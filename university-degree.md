A university degree is required if you apply for blue card.

# Is My University Degree Recognized or not in Germany?

Check if your university and degree are recognized or not in Germany [HERE](http://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/hochschulabschluesse.html "anabin.kmk.org"). \(anabin, mentioned in the blue card section in the work visa article\).

Useful tips for using anabin:

* Use google translate for this website.

* Search both "HochschulabschlÃ¼sse" \(university degrees\) and "Institutionen" \(institutions\)

* Download PDF and print \(needed for visa application\)

# ZAB

ZAB here means "Statement of Comparability for Foreign Higher Education Qualifications".

## Do I need ZAB

Official reply from German embassy in European country \(Estonia, to be specific\):

> * If your university is found in the search above, and your degree is also listed under your specific university, it is OK.
>
> * If your university is found in the search above, and your degree is not listed specifically under your university, but the degree however is listed in other universities in China, it is also OK, no need for Statement of Comparability for Foreign Higher Education Qualifications.
>
> * If your university is not found, even if your degree is listed under other universities, Statement of Comparability for Foreign Higher Education Qualifications is required.
>
> * Degree in English is OK

Note that on the website of German embassy website in China, it is explicitly said that the degree should be translated in Germany if the original version is not in English, but in my case I have a degree in Chinese, translated into English and notarized, and they accept it.

See here for more details on how to do "[Statement of Comparability for Foreign Higher Education Qualifications](https://www.kmk.org/zab/central-office-for-foreign-education/statement-of-comparability-for-foreign-higher-education-qualifications.html "www.kmk.org/zab")".

## How Long does ZAB take

In general it requires 3 months or so, but for the case of blue card application, it is done within 2 weeks.

## Required Documents for ZAB

The required documents differs depending on where you get your degree.
