## Online Booking

Train ticket online booking [HERE](https://www.bahn.de/en/view/index.shtml "www.bahn.de").

Cheaper if booked in advance.

## BahnCard

You will need it if you are a frequent traveller, or if you even use it on a daily basis as a way to commute.

See here [BahnCard](https://www.bahn.de/en/view/offers/bahncard/bahncard.shtml?dbkanal_007=L04_S02_D002_KIN0059_FLYOUT-ANGEBOTE-BAHNCARD_LZ01 "BahnCard info from www.bahn.de").

### Network Map

_See this section first to figure out which type of ticket you will need._

Network map and tariff map [HERE](https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/maps-stations/maps/index.html "Maps from mvv-muenchen.de").

### Day Ticket

In general you will need a day ticket, because single trip ticket is expensive if you need to go to someplace then come back on the same day.

See info about day ticket [HERE](https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-and-fares/tickets-daytickets/index.html "Day ticket from www.mvv-muenchen.de").

_Note that if you travel together with friends or families, group ticket is cheaper \(even if you are only 2 persons\)._

### Month Ticket

This option makes sense if you stay longer or live in Munich.

You will need to check the network maps above to decide which "ring" you will need. Monthly prices differ depending on the ring you choose.
