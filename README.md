# Everything You Need about Germany

Whether you are travelling to Germany or applying for a work visa or decide to relocate to Germany, here are all you need to know. Working Visa, travel info, living info, ... You name it; I have it.

Suggestion: follow every links. I hate copy and paste, so most of the time I just link you there, unless it's very important information.

Contributions are very welcome, but only with solid source. Info from official email/official website/personal experience are acceptable, but content copy/paste from random forum/bbs not verified personally is not acceptable.

If you find any bugs, like wrong messages, or invalid link, welcome to point it out and I will update as soon as possible.

My personal email in case you want to contact me: guotiexin@gmail.com
