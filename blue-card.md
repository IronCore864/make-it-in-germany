Till this step, all the documents the company needs from you are all done.

Next step is for yourself:

# Residence Permit / Blue Card

After registration of residency, next step is to apply for the residence permit. In the case of blue card, see [HERE](https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/home_en/Department-of-Public-Order/Foreigners-Office/International-professionals/Employment-self-employment-economic-migration.html).

Blue card can’t be applied from any bürgerbüro, but has to be applied in the “Landeshauptstadt München Kreisverwaltungsreferat – KVR” (search google map). Prepare another several hours of waiting. And most of the cases, you don’t even get to submit your application. What you get is an appointment in the near future before your visa is expired, then you come back again to apply for it.

If you are lucky enough (or unlucky, depends on how you look at it) to live in the blue circle regions, you have to go to the other office: Landratsamt München (search Mariahilfplatz 17 in google map). As you can see there are far less reviews here, so I guess probably the waiting time is much better. More info see HERE.

However if you live in neither center nor circle part of Munich, you have to apply for the blue card from the local foreigners office. Search for “Landratsamt” in your region.
