# P+R

P+R \(Park and Ride\) makes a great sense if you live far/want to drive to work but your work location is in city centre where the parking price is high or even very hard to find a place.

In general P+R parking facilities are all near subway stations, and they are cheap, like 10-20 EUR/month, and it's relatively close to city centre, for example, closest can be just a few stops.
