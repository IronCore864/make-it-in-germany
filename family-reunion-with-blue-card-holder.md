Required documents for family reunion with blue card/working visa/residence permit/eu members [HERE](https://china.diplo.de/blob/1341636/6a865b360d6d5efa20d28fccafce4c82/pdf-merkblatt-natvisum-ehegattennachzug-data.pdf "china.diplo.de") in Chinese.

_For reunion with blue card holders, no language certificate is needed._

The following is listed by German embassy in Estonia, in English, for the required documents for family reunion with blue card:

> * 2 x Application form for National Visa
> * 2 x Passport pictures
> * Your fingerprints \(taken at the time of the application at the embassy\)
> * Your valid Passport and two copies
> * Your valid Estonian ID-Card and two copies
> * The passport of your husband and two copies
> * Your marriage certificate and two copies \(regarding the notarization of the document, I will have to check if we can accept it\)
> * A letter stating that your husband wants to “invite” you to Germany to continue your marriage in Germany. 2 x originals of this letter and both signed by your husband.
> * Financial statement that you have the money to stay in Germany \(usually the work contract from your husband\) and two copies
> * Health insurance and two copies. This can be provided later, at the time the visa can be issued to you. Usually, when your husband begins his work in Germany, he will have health insurance through his work place and you will be able to be insured through him \("family insurance"\). What we need to see is,  that until you are insured through a German health insurance, you are still covered either by the Estonian health insurance or through a separate short term health insurance until the German one is valid.
