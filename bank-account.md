Next step, if you work, you should open a bank account.

German banks are in general expensive and don't have good service.

So here I recommend N26 which is a virtual online bank, whose name suggests that it has no real office, but besides that it's like a normal bank. Probably you have already seen the advertisement in subway stations.

You can get cash out from any ATM \(free for certain times a month\), and no monthly fee for the account nor the bank card.

You can open a new account online within just 10 minutes.
