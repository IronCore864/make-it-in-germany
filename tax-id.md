# Tax ID

When you register your residence, a tax ID will be generated and sent to you later within 4 weeks by post.

## Single
If you haven't given your tax ID to your company before firth month salary, you will be taxed by class 1/4 (they are the same amount), basically the maximum amount). It does not matter if you are single.

## Married 3+5/4+4

If you are married and want to get 3+5 instead of 4+4, you have to change it yourself. To do so, search your local finanzamt website, download the form which is used to change tax class for both you and your wife/husband, and fill them in, but you need your tax ID for this.

If you wait for a month for the letter containing the tax ID to arrive then change it next month, first month you will be taxed still by class 1/4, but the money is not lost; after you change your class to 3, give it to your company and the tax you paid more last month will come back with your next salary. If your company doesn't do so, you can still have it back at the end of year when you do tax refund.

If you want to save the trouble of paying more tax then get it back later, you can go to finanzamt 1 week or so after your residency registration to ask for your tax ID then change your class as soon as possible.

Note that, if you are married, and if you don't do anything about the tax class thing, even if your partner doesn't work, by default, you will get 4+4, not 3+5.

If you want 3+5, you have to go to your financial office to change it. And after you move to another new address, you will need to register your residence there again, and change your tax class to 3+5 again, because by default it will turn back to 4+4.

## Lost

In case if you lost it, you can get it again by a simple click and some info on the internet:
