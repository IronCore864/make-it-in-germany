When moving to Munich to take up permanent residence \(staying for more than three months\), you must register your address within two weeks of your arrival.

It's not easy to rent an apartment in Munich, not to mention find one before you are physically here. So it's recommended to find a temporary place to stay like airbnb, and ask if your landlord is OK to give you a written confirmation (this so-called "Wohnungsgeberbestätigung").

Information see [HERE](https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/home_en/Department-of-Public-Order/Registration-Deregistration.html "www.muenchen.de").

As you can see there are many offices; just choose anyone that is close to you. Be prepared to wait in the line for like 3 hours or so.

This should be done as soon as possible, ideally before your first working day, because it affects your tax, see more info in the tax section.

[HERE](http://www.landkreis-muenchen.de/landkreis/gemeinden-und-staedte/) is the map of Munich area. As you can see, the white region is the center part of Munich while the blue ones around it is the “circle” part around center Munich. If you live in the blue parts, you have to go to the “rathaus” inside your region to register residency, where probably there are less people thus less waiting time.
