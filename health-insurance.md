# General Health Insurance

Next you need to register for public health insurance.

In Germany there are public and private health insurance to choose from, and even for public ones, there are many companies to choose from. The public insurance in general is the same, but some do offer wider range of coverage, and provide better service. Personally I chose TK insurance.

Your salary must pass a certain number in order to apply for a private health insurance.

Public ones are more or less fixed price no matter how old you are, with downside being if you want to meet a specialist doctor, you will have to wait for like 2-3 months. Private insurance is cheaper when you are young but it increases as you grow older so it’s very expensive for older people, but you can get access to specialist doctor much sooner.

As far as I know, people, especially foreigners in Munich, around age 30 or so, mostly choose public insurance. Some local couples that both work around the same age, may choose public for one person and private for the other.

To apply for public health insurance, you need to bring your work contract, passport, and residency registration and a photo; go to the office, and that’s all.

In case you include your wife in the insurance as well you will need her signature and information and picture as well.

After health insurance you will get social security number and health insurance card, both sent by mail.
