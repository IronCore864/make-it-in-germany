                                <p>It&#x2019;s not easy to find an apartment for rent in Germany.</p>
<p>You know, I think I&#x2019;m wrong; I take the above sentence back. The right way to say it should be: It&#x2019;s fucking hard to find an apartment in Germany.</p>
<p>Like how hard? You may ask. Let me give you an example:</p>
<p>A friend of mine took 8 months to find an ideal apartment.</p>
<p>A friend of mine pays 1500/month for a two room (1 bedroom+1 living room) in Munich city center (it&#x2019;s very good location though).</p>
<p>Another friend sent out 52 emails and got only 1 reply so he had to take it. It&#x2019;s not very center, but still within the center part of Munich. (See my other post for the center/circle map of Munich).</p>
<p>Another friend sent out over 200 mails and got several invitation to visit the apartment.</p>
<p>For myself, I didn&#x2019;t even look for apartments in the center part of Munich in the first place, at all. I went far.</p>
<p>But even though, I sent out 18 emails (no call at all because non of those advertisements had phone number), and I got only 6 replies.</p>
<p>Of the 6 replies, one immediately told me it was already rented out.</p>
<p>One asked me for this damn schufa thing (credit check in Germany) and 3 month salary proof, which you sure don&#x2019;t have if you just start your life here.</p>
<p>One showed me a webpage for a 3D tour and asked me for more info and I never heard from it again.</p>
<p>The other three kindly invited me over to visit their apartments, but they all were far away. How far? It&#x2019;s 30, 50, 60 km from Hauptbahnhof respectively. Even it&#x2019;s far, for one of the three, the landlord held a paper that has 14 names on it, which I guessed were the people that were going to visit the apartment on the same day. Not sure even if I accepted this one, would I get it or not.</p>
<p>Only two options have me alone on the same day without other visitors. But one of them asked high price for newly installed kitchen. The other one, I was lucky, because they spoke my language. Acceptable location, outside Munich outer circle, 30+ min by S Bahn to hauptbahnhof, no refrigerator no washing machine. So I took it. I&#x2019;m sure there will be more choices, but since I only have 1 month in the temporary airbnb with only 3 weeks left, I have to find something, quick. Besides, even if I didn&#x2019;t take it, there weren&#x2019;t more options for me to continue writing emails to, because they were too expensive, not ideal location, no kitchen, not available before the end of my airbnb, etc.</p>
<p>For me the whole process took 4 days of writing emails, 2 days apartment seeing. I was lucky enough to find a place on the 11th day in Munich, although it&#x2019;s outside Munich.</p>
<p>Tips? There are some:</p>
<h1 id="add-as-much-info-as-possible-in-your-immobilienscout24-account">Add as much info as possible in your immobilienscout24 account</h1>
<p>I even uploaded real person photo, salary, family situation, etc. I&#x2019;m not land lord but I think it helps when they see your info they see your photo and detailed stuff.</p>
<h1 id="write-email-in-german">Write email in German</h1>
<p>Try to learn some German online before you come.</p>
<p>Then write email in German, with the help of google translate of course.</p>
<p>Old people in Germany in general don&#x2019;t speak good English, if any at all. Chances are, if you are rich enough to become landlords, you are probably old enough not to be able to speak English.</p>
<p>If you write English emails you will scare a lot of landlords away. Even if you speak very little poor German, you still have a better chance. Maybe by not much, but still better. Don&#x2019;t worry about talking with the landlords if you are lucky to be invited to see the apartment. You can still get by with google translate and your limited poor German skills.</p>
<p>I got 6 replies out of 18 emails, compared to my examples of my friends above, it&#x2019;s quite impressive. Although I only applied for further choices, but still.</p>
<h1 id="go-far">Go far</h1>
<p>In my observation foreigners from European countries or the US like to live in the city center a lot. They are willing to pay like 1/3 or even more for rent so that they can live in the yellow region of the city on google map.</p>
<p>But it&#x2019;s a stupid idea, forgive my language.</p>
<p>Yes you save some money on public transportation, but you spend much more on rent, and parking (if you have a car), and anyway you won&#x2019;t be able to drive at all since it&#x2019;s the city center and it is crowded.</p>
<p>You may argue that you save time that money can&#x2019;t buy, but in most of the cases it&#x2019;s not the case. Say you live 5 subway stops away from city center, which is 10min on the subway, further from city center so better traffic, but still it&#x2019;s very close to city center so the price is still high, and you need maybe another bus or 10min walk to the subway station because chances are your house is not right there next to the entrance of the subway. So in total it&#x2019;s still 20-30min even if you live within ring 2 of Munich.</p>
<p>You can live at ring 8 near S bahn and still get to the city center within 30-40min. You can even live in another city which is 60km away and with inter city express train, you still get to Munich city center with 30min.</p>
<p>So look for some place further, but do your math about how long it takes to commute by subway/car, how much for parking in P+R then transfer to subway, how much money you save by living further and how much more money you need to spend on public transportation or gas. All things considered well enough, it&#x2019;s totally worth it.</p>
