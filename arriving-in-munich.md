# Residence Registration

When moving to Munich to take up permanent residence \(staying for more than three months\), you must register your address within two weeks of your arrival.

Information see [HERE](https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/home_en/Department-of-Public-Order/Registration-Deregistration.html "www.muenchen.de").

# Residence Permit / Blue Card

After registration of residency, next step is to apply for the residence permit. In the case of blue card, see [HERE](https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/home_en/Department-of-Public-Order/Foreigners-Office/International-professionals/Employment-self-employment-economic-migration.html).

# Bank Account

Next if you work you should open a bank account. German banks are in general expensive and don't have good service.

So here I recommend N26 which is a virtual online bank, whose name suggests that it has no real office, but besides that it's like a normal bank. You can get cash out from any ATM \(free for certain times a month\), and no monthly fee for the account nor the bank card. You can open a new account online within just 10 minutes.

# General Health Insurance

Next you need to register for public health insurance.

In Germany there are public and private health insurance to choose from, and even for public ones, there are many companies to choose from. The public insurance in general is the same, but some do offer wider range of coverage, and provide better service.

You need to bring your work contract, passport, and residency registration and a photo and that's all.

In case you include your wife in the insurance as well you will need her signature and information and picture as well.

After health insurance you will get social security number as well, which is posted by mail.

# Tax class/Steuernummer

A simple click and some info on the internet:

But it takes about 4 Weeks to get it by post.
